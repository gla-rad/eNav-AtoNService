## What is e-Navigation
The maritime domain is facing a number for challenges, mainly due to the
increasing demand, that may increase the risk of an accident or loss of life.
These challenges require technological solutions and e-Navigation is one such
solution. The International Maritime Organization ([IMO](https://www.imo.org/))
adopted a ‘Strategy for the development and implementation of e‐Navigation’
(MSC85/26, Annexes 20 and 21), providing the following definition of
e‐Navigation:

<div style="padding: 4px;
    background:lightgreen;
    border:2px;
    border-style:solid;
    border-radius:20px;
    color:black">
E-Navigation, as defined by the IMO, is the harmonised collection, integration,
exchange, presentation and analysis of maritime information on-board and ashore
by electronic means to enhance berth-to-berth navigation and related services,
for safety and security at sea and protection of the marine environment.
</div>

In response, the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities 
([IALA](https://www.iala-aism.org/)) published a number of guidelines such as 
[G1113](https://www.iala-aism.org/product/g1113/) and
[G1114](https://www.iala-aism.org/product/g1114/), which establish the relevant
principles for the design and implementation of harmonised shore-based technical
system architectures and propose a set of best practices to be followed. In
these, the terms Common Shore‐Based System (CSS) and Common Shore‐based System
Architecture (CSSA) were introduced to describe the shore‐based technical system
of the IMO’s overarching architecture.

To ensure the secure communication between ship and CSSA, the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), in coordination with IALA, compiled a set of
system architecture and operational requirements for e-Navigation into a
standard better known as [SECOM](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/64543).
This provides mechanisms for secure data exchange, as well as a TS interface
design that is in accordance with the service guidelines and templates defined
by IALA. Although SECOM is just a conceptual standard, the Maritime Connectivity
Platform ([MCP](https://maritimeconnectivity.net/)) provides an actual
implementation of a decentralised framework that supports SECOM.

## What is the GRAD e-Navigation Service Architecture

The GLA follow the developments on e-Navigation closely, contributing through
their role as an IALA member whenever possible. As part of their efforts, a
prototype GLA e-Navigation Service Architecture is being developed by the GLA
Research and Development Directorate (GRAD), to be used as the basis for the
provision of the future GLA e-Navigation services.

As a concept, the CSSA is based on the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). A
pure-SOA approach however was found to be a bit cumbersome for the GLA
operations, as it usually requires the entire IT landscape being compatible,
resulting in high investment costs. In the context of e-Navigation, this could
become a serious problem, since different components of the system are designed
by independent teams/manufacturers. Instead, a more flexible microservice
architecture was opted for. This is based on a break-down of the larger
functional blocks into small independent services, each responsible for
performing its own orchestration, maintaining its own data and communicating
through lightweight mechanisms such as HTTP/HTTPS. It should be pointed out that
SOA and the microservice architecture are not necessarily that different.
Sometimes, microservices are even considered as an extension or a more
fine-grained version of SOA.

## The e-Navigation Message Broker Service

This is the core service supporting the provision of AtoN information. It
follows the SECOM standard and it is implemented in accordance with the 
"Technical Specification for the Provision of AtoN Information Service to
End-users" guideline being developed by IALA. It stores all the published AtoN
messages generated by Niord (including VAtoN), allows clients to retrieve them
based on various search criteria, and supports geo-spatial queries. It currently
employs a premature version of the IHO S-125 data format, since the final data
product specification is not yet published. The “AtoN Service” monitors the AtoN
information published to the
[Message Broker](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/glarad/enav-msg-broker/)
and updates its list of defined datasets when applicable. It also supports the
SECOM subscription operation,

## How to use this image

This image can be used in two ways (based on the use or not of the Spring Cloud
Config server). 
* Enabling the cloud config client and using the configurations located in an 
online repository.
* Disabling the cloud config client and using the configuration provided
locally.

### Cloud Config Configuration

In order to run the image in a **Cloud Config** configuration, you just need
to provide the environment variables that allow is to connect to the cloud
config server. This is assumed to be provided the GRAD e-Navigation Service
Architecture
[Eureka Service](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/glarad/enav-eureka/).

The available environment variables are:
    
    ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_URI=<The URL of the eureka cloud configuration server>
    ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_BRANCH=<The cloud configuration repository branch to be used>
    ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_USERNAME=<The cloud configration server username>
    ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_PASSWORD=<The cloud configration server password>
    
The parameters will be picked up and used to populate the default
**bootstrap.properties** of the service that look as follows:

    server.port=8766
    spring.application.name=aton-service
    spring.application.version=<application.version>
    
    # The Spring Cloud Discovery Config
    spring.cloud.config.uri=${ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_URI}
    spring.cloud.config.username=${ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_USERNAME}
    spring.cloud.config.password=${ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_PASSWORD}
    spring.cloud.config.label=${ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_BRANCH}
    spring.cloud.config.fail-fast=false

As you can see, the service is called **aton-service** and uses the **8766** 
port when running.

To run the image, along with the aforementioned environment variables, you can
use the following command:

    docker run -t -i --rm \
        -p 8766:8766 \
        -e ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_URI='<cloud config server url>' \
        -e ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_BRANCH='<cloud config config repository branch>' \
        -e ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_USERNAME='<config config repository username>' \
        -e ENAV_CLOUD_CONFIG_PASSWORD='<config config repository passord>' \
        <image-id>

### Local Config Configuration

In order to run the image in a **Local Config** configuration, you just need
to mount a local configuration directory that contains the necessary 
**.properties** files (including bootstrap) into the **/conf** directory of the
image.

This can be done in the following way:

    docker run -t -i --rm \
        -p 8766:8766 \
        -v /path/to/config-directory/on/machine:/conf \
        <image-id>

Examples of the required properties files can be seen below.

For bootstrapping, we need to disable the cloud config client, and clear our the
environment variable inputs:
    
    server.port=8766
    spring.application.name=aton-service
    spring.application.version=<application.version>
    
    # Disable the cloud config
    spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
    
    # The Spring Cloud Discovery Config
    spring.cloud.config.uri=
    spring.cloud.config.username=
    spring.cloud.config.password=
    spring.cloud.config.label=

While the application properties need to provide the service with an OAuth2.0
server like keycloak, logging configuration, the eureka client connection etc.:

## Operation

The core operation of the “AtoN Service” involves monitoring the “S125” topic of
the Kafka publish-subscribe broker, for messages generated by the **Message
Broker**. Upon a message being published there, whether an AtoN creation/update
or a deletion, the service will react by updating its AtoN database and then
initiating an S-125 dataset update operation. The whole operation starts when
the service receives a message from the publish-subscribe channel. First, the
message validity is checked (for example if it is correctly formatted), and then
the affected geometry is compared against the geographical area defined for this
**AtoN Service** instance. This allows the application to provide a selective
service with a specific coverage and not clutter its database with AtoN
information that could be potentially irrelevant. If any of those checks fail,
then the received message is dropped.

If the received message is valid, the service will process it and extract the
AtoN information which will subsequently be stored in its AtoN database.
Afterwards, the **AtoN Service** will attempt to identify which of the already
defined S-125 datasets are affected by the AtoN information received. Normally
we expect only one dataset to be affected, namely the one that includes the
geographical location of the AtoN in question. However, in some more complex
scenarios, where datasets can be defined in a hierarchical way, there could
potentially be multiple ones. For all affected datasets, the updated S-125
content will be generated and the output will once again be stored in the
database.

The new content will include all AtoN that fall into the geographical boundaries
defined for the specific S-125 dataset. An important point to be made here is
that the service will also create an additional data entry for the updated
dataset content in a separate database table for logging purposes. This way,
all dataset changes will be recorded and can be retrieved for auditing purposes.

Finally, once all the affected S-125 datasets have been updated, the active
SECOM subscriptions that are affected by the dataset changes will be informed.
Active SECOM subscriptions in this context are all the subscriptions initiated
via the SECOM “subscribe” interface which are valid in terms of the starting
and ending dates and times specified.

Two more areas of functionality provided by the **AtoN Service** involve the
management of S-125 datasets and SECOM subscriptions. In terms of the S-125
datasets, these are assigned with detailed identification information and can
be defined for specific geographical areas. This functionality is currently
accessible through the application’s own web-interface (GUI), and only
authorised users have access to it. The contents of an S-125 dataset however
are generated automatically by the service.

SECOM subscriptions on the other hand, are generated upon SECOM client requests
towards the SECOM “Subscription” interface of the “AtoN Service”. Subscriptions
can be setup on a specific S-125 dataset, on a geographic area, or any
combination of the two. In the same way, subscriptions can also be dropped by
the clients using the SECOM “Delete Subscription”. In certain cases however,
when the subscription period finishes, or the dataset specified in a
subscription has been deleted, it is the responsibility of the “AtoN Service”
to cancel the subscription and inform the corresponding clients.
