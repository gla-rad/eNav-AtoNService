/**
 * The S-125 AIS Aids to Navigation Entity Class.
 * <p>
 * This class is not really defined in S-125 (althought this might not be such
 * a bad idea) and it was introduced so that we can easily model and extend
 * the three AIS AtoN types, i.e the Physical, the Virtual and the Synthetic
 * one.
